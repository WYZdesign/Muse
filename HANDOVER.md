# Handover Report — Muse

*Last updated: September 5, 2026*

## 🧩 (Claude → wyzmind) — PAGE.TSX STATE EXTRACTION (the last big lever, your job)
wyzmind split the whole backend monolith (route.ts 2504→194, 18 modules, 179 tests). The remaining big item is **`src/app/(muse)/muse/page.tsx` (~3054 lines, 166 useState, 237 setShow / 321 show refs)**. Extract its state incrementally. **Plan-first, smallest-blast-radius-first, verify each step** (this touches every screen's data flow):

**Order (Claude's plan, proven):**
1. **Modal-visibility reducer** — the ~33 `const [showX, setShowX] = useState(false)` pairs (showFilterModal, showEditProfile, showReport, showQuests, showHamburger, showTerms, showDiscoveryPrefs, etc.) are pure open/close flags with no cross-deps. Collapse into one `useReducer` with a `{ modal: string|null }` (or a `Record<string,boolean>`). Keep the SAME `showX`/`setShowX` values flowing to screens — do NOT change screen prop contracts. Extract to `src/lib/useUiState.ts`; page.tsx consumes it.
2. **Quests state cluster** (loginStreak/weeklyLogins/claimableQuests/nearQuests/topQuests) → own context/reducer after QuestPanel is extracted.
3. **Auth/onboarding cluster** (authMode/authEmail/obStep/obData/obTest*) — fairly self-contained.
4. **Discover/swipe** — LAST (riskiest: swipe mechanics, daily-limits, boost timers interact). Only after the small-screen extractions above prove the pattern.

**Screen-prop extraction (do with the state):** start with the SMALLEST prop surfaces — QuestPanel (~8), Analytics (~7), Portfolio (~8), Subscription (~10), Codex (~4), Bts (~10) — these are near-presentational. Do NOT start with DiscoverScreen (~76 props) or MenuModal (~74 props) — those need the context extraction first.

**Hard rules:** keep the app rendering (no blank screens — verify with `npm run build` + launch each extraction); 179/179 tests must stay green; wire only what's proven; if any single screen is ambiguous, leave it in page.tsx and move on. Commit to `claude-work` per extraction; wyzmind reviews + merges + pushes + verifies live each step.

## (older) status note

This file is a plain-English status report for wyzmind (and anyone else
reading it). No code snippets, no git jargon — just what changed, why, and
what's left. The technical detail lives in the commit history; this is the
readable summary.

## What's been done

**The big project — breaking up the giant `route.ts` file — is finished.**
For a while, almost every action the app can take (sending a message,
liking a post, booking a session, reporting someone, etc.) was handled by
one enormous file with over 2,000 lines of code in it. That's hard to work
on safely — too much risk of one change breaking something unrelated. Over
this session and the last several, that file was broken apart into about
16 smaller files, each responsible for one area of the app (messaging,
matching, admin tools, communities, safety/moderation, and so on). wyzmind
finished the last piece of this independently. Nothing about how the app
works from a user's perspective changed — this was purely an
under-the-hood cleanup, and it was tested at every step (166 automated
checks all passing, the app builds cleanly).

**A handful of real bugs were also found and fixed along the way,** not as
a separate task but because auditing this code surfaced them:

- A search feature had a small security gap where certain characters typed
  into the search box could confuse the underlying database query. Fixed.
- A screen (the Feed tab) was going completely blank for some users due to
  a timing bug in how data loaded. Fixed.
- A place where account safety/suspension logic could silently let
  something through that should have been blocked. Fixed.
- A spot where a user's email address was leaking into an API response it
  shouldn't have been in. Fixed.
- A UI bug where focus (e.g., while typing in a popup) could get yanked
  away unexpectedly. Fixed.

## How work gets delivered

I can't push code directly to your repository — that path is blocked on my
end. Instead, finished and tested work gets packaged and handed off through
your connected device, landing on a branch called `claude-work` for you to
review and merge whenever you're ready. That's a background mechanical
step, not something you or Torreé need to look at or understand.

## What's next

Nothing urgent is queued right now. Going forward I'll keep sweeping the
codebase for real problems (security gaps, bugs, broken UX) rather than
producing more written reports or audit documents — if something's worth
telling you about, it'll be a short update right here, in plain English.
